Welcome to my Kanban Board built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I find Jekyll to be a natural fit for organizing non-blog related things so to a certain extent, I am curious how far I can take this.

Because I am incrementally building this Kanban engine, please consider that things may change in my repo with relatively little notice. That said, please see the [README](/README.html) for instructions on usage!

Please begin by visiting the [Kanban](/kanban.html) page!
