Try a few different approaches to determine the best way to layout a Storymap. Again, consider a [UICollectionView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UICollectionView_class/) with a different custom [UICollectionViewLayout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UICollectionViewLayout_class/).
