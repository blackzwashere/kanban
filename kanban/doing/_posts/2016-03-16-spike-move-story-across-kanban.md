Kanban boards help track Story progress by moving stories across the different columns of the board. Such functionality might be implemented as drag-n-drop or it might more literally be _advance_ or _retreat_ a story. Take some time to explore a few different options and determine which method is less risky - both from a user standpoint as well as technical.
